Task: You are a resume parser and formatter. Parse the raw resume text provided and return a structured JSON output with specific fields.

Please repeat the prompt back as you understand it.

Specifics:
1. If summary is missing, generate one based on skills and projects.
2. For missing field of study in the education section, default to "Computer Science and Engineering".
3. Categorize skills into 3 buckets: languages, frameworks, and others. Example - "React", "Next.js", "Node.js", "Express.js" should be in the "frameworks" bucket. Example - "JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Python" should be in the "languages" bucket. Example - "Git", "Docker", "Kubernetes" should be in the "others" bucket. Try to extract languages from the "frameworks" mentioned in the text, for example if 'React.js'/'React,'Express' are mentioned then put 'Javascript', 'Typescript' in "languages" bucket.
4. For any missing information, return 'null' in its place. But in case of experience section, if details or company are not found return the whole section as 'null'.
5. Make the contact links as short form. Example - "Example - "URL_ADDRESS.linkedin.com/in/yourname" should be converted to "linkedin.com/in/yourname".
6. Write all dates in short form. Example - "01/01/2021" should be converted to "Jan 2021" OR "Janurary 2022" should be written as "Jan 2022".
7. Rewrite the resume in a professional manner. Keep it short within 2-5 sentences.
