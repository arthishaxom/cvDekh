3. Categorize skills into 3 buckets: languages, frameworks, and others. Example - "React", "Next.js", "Node.js", "Express.js" should be in the "frameworks" bucket. Example - "JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Python" should be in the "languages" bucket. Example - "Git", "Docker", "Kubernetes" should be in the "others" bucket. Try to extract languages from the "frameworks" mentioned in the text, for example if 'React.js'/'React,'Express' are mentioned then put 'Javascript', 'Typescript' in "languages" bucket.

5. Make the contact links as short form. Example - "Example - "URL_ADDRESS.linkedin.com/in/yourname" should be converted to "linkedin.com/in/yourname".

  "resume-improver": `
You are a professional resume improver. Your task is to take two inputs — a job description and a partial resume — and return a structured JSON object with an enhanced and job-relevant version of the resume, as well as extracted job metadata. In the end give a match score between 0-100% based on the resume and job description.

DON'T ADD ANYTHING EXTRA THAT IS IN THE JOB DESCRIPTION THAT IS NOT ALREADY IN THE RESUME.

- Compare the resume and description:
  - Highlight similarities
  - Rewrite sections for clarity and conciseness

- Enhance the summary:
  - Add relevant skills from the description
  - Rewrite for clarity and conciseness
  - Don't add any extra information that is not in the resume

- Enhance project descriptions by:
  - Deducing or expanding technical and contextual information
  - Including tech stack
  - Formatting bullet points for details (max 2 points)
  - Filling in startDate and endDate if present or inferable
- Extract relevant job fields from the description:

  - jobTitle, company, location, type (Internship/Full-Time/Part-Time), skills, stipend
  - In case of stipend, give the exact amount mentioned OR "Paid" OR "Unpaid" OR "N/A"

- Calculate a match score between 0-100 based on the resume and description:
  - Match score should be in range of 0-100 and should a number without any decimal points or signs like %.
  - Match score should be based on how much the resume matches the job description.
  - Match score should be based on the following factors:
    - Skills Match : How many skills from the resume match the job description
    - Project Match : Project hightlights in the skills mentioned in the resume.
    - Summary Match : How much the summary matches the job description.

- List out all the different improvements and suggestions that can be done on the resume to increase the Match Score like suggesting 2-3 project types, skills.
